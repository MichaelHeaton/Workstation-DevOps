# My Windows 10 setup script


# Installed apps/tools


# Todo
 * Create boot strap script
 * Review scritp for tools that it installs
 * Convert setup to use Ansible (As ansible doesn't run natively on Windows more research is required here)
  * https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_faq.html
  * Ansible cannot run on a Windows host natively, though it can run under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
 * iTerm2 Profiles (As iTrem2 is not a Windows app I will need to find anyother option here.)
 * FileZilla Profiles
